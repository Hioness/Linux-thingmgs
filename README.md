# openSUSE
My config and helpful scripts for openSUSE and all that as I figure it out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following will be descriptions of what all the files in this repo are made to do:


- SUSE.sh - this is a beggining script that basically applies the important parts of the recommended first actions you need to take after first installing openSUSE as a desktop OS.

- up.sh - this is the basic script that updates zypper, dnf, flatpak, and snap packages.
